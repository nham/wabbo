title: What is this for?
---

Reasons why I might write a thing here:

 - so that future-me (and any other person sufficiently similar to present-me) has a good reference for the thing in question
 - I wanted to learn something and I thought that explaining it publicly would help focus my learning efforts
 - to practice writing
 - to discover what I know (and don't know) about a topic
