In what follows, let $(\Sigma, \mathcal{E}, \mathbb{P})$ be a probability space.


 - probability of complement is complement of probability
 - probability is monotonic on set inclusion: $A \subseteq B$ implies $\mathbb{P}(A) \leq \mathbb{P}(B)$
 - inclusion/exclusion

Discuss limit of a sequence of probabilities for a nested sequence of events. Wasserman calls this (and he's right) the continuity of probability.

Define condition probability $\mathbb{P}(A | B)$ when $\mathbb{P}(B) > 0$.

If you have a partition of the sample space by events, with each partition having non-zero probability, you can decompose probability of an event using conditional probability.

Bayes theorem? It's just writing out the definition of conditional probability?

Independent events. Show how it relates to conditional probability.
