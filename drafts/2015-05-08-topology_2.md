## (probably bad) Bases

There is a general pattern in math of finding things that can generate some more complicated other thing.

 - Topological Basis => Topological space
 - subbasis => basis
 - small finite collection of vectors => finite dimensional vector space
 - in measure theory, the Borel algebra on R can be generated from sets (-inf, a] or whatever


## Bases

One important notion for topological spaces is **bases**. The idea is that a **basis** is a collection of *primitive* open sets that is used to generate the rest of the topology. The definition is any collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $X$ such that

    - $\bigcup \mathcal{B} = X$
    - for all $A, B \in \mathcal{B}$, $A \cap B$ is a union of elements in $\mathcal{B}$.


## Coarseness/fineness of topologies

If $X$ is a set and $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ are topologies on $X$ such that every open set in $\mathcal{S}$ is an open set in $\mathcal{T}$, then $\mathcal{S}$ is said to be **coarser** than $\mathcal{T}$, and $\mathcal{T}$ **finer** than $\mathcal{S}$.

The coarsest topology on any set $X$ is the **trivial topology** $\{ \emptyset, X\}$, while the finest topology, the power set of $X$, is called the **discrete topology**.

Here's an interesting characterization of the coarseness/fineness relation: $\mathcal{S}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{T}$ iff the identity map $id: X \to X$ is a homeomorphism when considered as a map

$$(X, \mathcal{T}) \to (X, \mathcal{S})$$

between topological spaces.


## Basic separation axioms

### Hausdorff spaces

A sufficient (but not necessary) condition for ensuring uniqueness of limits for sequences in a topological space is the **Hausdorff** property. This property says that any two distinct points in a topological space have disjoint neighborhoods. Any space with this property is called a **Hausdorff space**. This ensures uniqueness of limits since two tail sequences of one sequence could not be contained in two disjoint sets (the smaller of the tail sequences would have to be contained in two disjoint sets, which is clearly not possible).

Hausdorff-ness is a topological property: If $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic, then $X$ is Hausdorff iff $Y$ is. To see this, if $f: X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism and $X$ is Hausdorff, for any $u, v \in Y$, then $a := f^{-1}(u)$ and $b := f^{-1}(v)$ are in $X$, so they have neighborhoods $U_x$ and $V_y$, respectively, that are disjoint. Then $f(U_x)$ and $f(V_y)$ are neighborhoods of $u$ and $v$, respectively, and they must be disjoint since if $z = f(c) = f(d)$ for some $c \in U_x, d \in V_y$, then $f$ is not bijective.

TODO: An example of a non-Hausdorff space where limits are unique.

### $T_1$ spaces

Another separation axiom that has come up: A space is $T_1$ if for any pair of distinct points $a$ and $b$, there are neighborhoods $U$ and $V$ of $a$ and $b$, respectively, such that $U$ doesn't contain $b$ and $V$ doesn't contain $a$. Clearly Hausdorff spaces are $T_1$, since they actually impose a stronger condition: that the neighborhoods are *disjoint*.

A space $X$ is $T_1$ iff singleton sets are closed. If $T_1$, for any $x$ and any $y \neq x$, there is a neighborhood $U_y$ of $y$ that does not contain $x$ by the $T_1$ property, so the union of them all is $X - x$ and is open since it is a union of open sets. (Alternate proof: if $\{x\}$ is not closed, there is some $a \neq x$ and every neighborhood of $a$ contains $x$, contradicting $T_1$). Conversely, if all singletons are closed, then for $x \neq y$, $X - x$ is a neighborhood of $y$ and $X - y$ is a neighborhood of $x$, and these mutually exclude each other.

$T_1$ spaces do not necessarily have the unique limits property. TODO: example. Finite complement topology on $\mathbb{N}$?

### A lemma

In a $T_1$ space, if $a$ is a limit point of some subset $S$, then for any neighborhood $U$ of $a$ there must be infinitely many points distinct from $a$ that are in $U \cap S$, because if there are only finitely many, we can find a neighborhood of $a$ that does not intersect $S - a$, contradicting that it's a limit point.
