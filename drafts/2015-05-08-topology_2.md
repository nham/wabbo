## (probably bad) Bases

There is a general pattern in math of finding things that can generate some more complicated other thing.

 - Topological Basis => Topological space
 - subbasis => basis
 - small finite collection of vectors => finite dimensional vector space
 - in measure theory, the Borel algebra on R can be generated from sets (-inf, a] or whatever


## Bases

One important notion for topological spaces is **bases**. The idea is that a **basis** is a collection of *primitive* open sets that is used to generate the rest of the topology. The definition is any collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $X$ such that

    - $\bigcup \mathcal{B} = X$
    - for all $A, B \in \mathcal{B}$, $A \cap B$ is a union of elements in $\mathcal{B}$.
