## Representing the board

During play, each cell of a tic-tac-toe board can either have an `X` marked in it, an `O` marked in it, or no mark:

```rust
pub enum Cell { X, O, Nil }
```

A 3x3 tic-tac-toe board can then be represented as an array of arrays of `Cell`:

```rust
pub struct Board {
    state: [[Cell; 3]; 3],
}
```

We can give `Board`s a method that returns a reference to a cell:

```rust
impl Board {
    pub fn get(&self, row: usize, col: usize) -> &Cell {
        &self.state[row][col]
    }
}
```

Here's another method, this time for checking whether the `Board` is drawn (i.e. neither player is able to win). It checks whether all the spaces are filled up with X's and O's:

```rust
impl Board {
    pub fn is_drawn(&self) -> bool {
        for row in self.state.iter() {
            for cell in row.iter() {
                match *cell {
                    Cell::Nil => return false,
                    _ => {},
                }
            }
        }
        true
    }
}
```

Note that this doesn't do any fancy analysis for detecting boards with empty spaces that are nevertheless un-winnable. This might be a nice improvement in the future, but is not essential here.

We can also check if the game has been won:

```rust
impl Board {
    pub fn is_won(&self) -> Option<PlayerId> {
        use game::Cell::{X, O};
        match *self.as_array() {
            [[X, X, X], _, _]
            | [_, [X, X, X], _]
            | [_, _, [X, X, X]]
            | [[X, _, _], [X, _, _], [X, _, _]]
            | [[_, X, _], [_, X, _], [_, X, _]]
            | [[_, _, X], [_, _, X], [_, _, X]]
            | [[X, _, _], [_, X, _], [_, _, X]]
            | [[_, _, X], [_, X, _], [X, _, _]] => Some(PlayerId::P1),

            [[O, O, O], _, _]
            | [_, [O, O, O], _]
            | [_, _, [O, O, O]]
            | [[O, _, _], [O, _, _], [O, _, _]]
            | [[_, O, _], [_, O, _], [_, O, _]]
            | [[_, _, O], [_, _, O], [_, _, O]]
            | [[O, _, _], [_, O, _], [_, _, O]]
            | [[_, _, O], [_, O, _], [O, _, _]] => Some(PlayerId::P2),

            _ => None,
        }
    }
```

The `PlayerId` type used above is defined like this:

```rust
pub enum PlayerId { P1, P2 }
```

They are symbols that we can use to play a game of tic-tac-toe.

## Playing the game

Here is a way to toggle between `PlayerId`s, as if the players were taking turns:


```rust
impl PlayerId {
    fn next(&self) -> PlayerId {
        match *self {
            PlayerId::P1 => PlayerId::P2,
            PlayerId::P2 => PlayerId::P1,
        }
    }
}
```

A game of tic-tac-toe needs the following data at minimum:

 - two players who are playing
 - a game board that the players take turn marking (with either `X` or `O`)
 - a field that records whether the player currently taking a turn is player 1 or player 2

In code:

```rust
struct TTTGame<'a> {
    current: PlayerId,
    players: [&'a mut RLPlayer; 2],
    board: Board,
}
```

The first `RLPlayer` in the `players` array is taken to be player 1 (and the second player 2). This convention is encoded in the following private method for retrieving a mutable reference to the current `RLPlayer`:

```rust
impl<'a> TTTGame<'a> {
    fn current_player(&mut self) -> &mut RLPlayer {
        match self.current {
            PlayerId::P1 => self.players[0],
            PlayerId::P2 => self.players[1],
        }
    }
}
```

A method `play` for playing the game might look something like this:

```rust
enum GameResult {
    Wins(PlayerId),
    Draw,
}

impl<'a> TTTGame<'a> {
    fn play(&mut self) -> GameResult {
        loop {
            self.player_action();

            if let Some(winner) = self.is_won() {
                return GameResult::Wins(winner)
            }
            
            if self.is_drawn() {
                return GameResult::Draw
            }
        }
    }

    fn player_action(&mut self) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
        let board = self.board;
        match self.current_player().choose_action(&board) {
            Some((i, j)) => {
                self.current_player_mark_cell(i, j);
                self.next_player();
                Ok(())
            },
            None => Err("No remaining actions."),
        }
    }

    fn current_player_mark_cell(&mut self, row: usize, col: usize) {
        let xo = self.current_XO();
        self.board.set_cell(i, j, xo);
    }

    fn next_player(&mut self) {
        self.current = self.current.next();
    }
}
```

The `choose_action` method we will come to later.
