I didn't end up fixing Rust #25694 as discussed last time because it looked somewhat difficult to do once I dug into the code. I looked at a couple different issues before settling on [issue \#21546][issue-21546]. This is an interesting bug in which the program

```rust
mod Foo {}
struct Foo(i32);

fn main() {}
```

compiles (try it on Rust 1.0, it totally works). It works when `Foo` is any tuple struct, including a unit struct `struct Foo;`. Also, the other `Foo` has to be a module. It does not work when the module is replaced with a trait, type alias, enum, or struct named `Foo`.

The program above can be extended to the following questionable program:

```rust
mod Foo {
    pub fn foo() -> &'static str { "module" }
}

struct Foo;

impl Foo {
    fn foo() -> &'static str { "struct" }
}

fn main() {
    println!("It came from the {}", Foo::foo()); // what should it print?
}
```

I think I have [a fix][fix-for-21546] for this, but since it will technically be a breaking change there is some discussion about how to proceed with it.

Last night and today I submitted a [couple][PR1] [of][PR2] pull requests to add regression tests for issues that were still open in the Rust tracker but had been fixed since the last time anyone looked at them. It took me awhile to realize that this was a thing that you can/should do (as opposed to just leaving a comment on the issue saying that it's fixed now).

I'm looking for another `rustc` bug to fix now. [Issue \#21225][issue-21225] looks interesting and potentially not too difficult, so I will probably try to work on this later tonight.

I have written at least half of the integrals blog post. All that remains is to prove some stuff (equivalence of Darboux & Riemann integrals, plus other things) and make pretty pictures. I also worked some on a post about discrete random variables that I've been meaning to finish and publish.

In other news, I'm very nearly finished with section 2.1 of Puterman. I hope to get through 2.2 by tonight or early tomorrow.
